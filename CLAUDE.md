# CLAUDE.md — Animatic Refinement Workflow

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code. It is the **first thing** you (future Claude)
should read when starting a new session in this repo. Read it fully before acting.

## What this project is

A 2-part AI pipeline that replaces the manual animator step for 2D Indian cartoon
production (Chota Bhim style).

- **Part 1 (this repo, in progress):** rough MP4 animatic shot → BnW line-art MP4
  with reference-accurate characters in correct positions.
- **Part 2 (future, separate effort):** ToonCrafter frame interpolation to generate
  in-between poses.

Input per project: client-provided MP4 shots + manually drawn character model
sheets (8-angle horizontal strip, transparent background, full color) + per-shot
metadata captured via an HTML form (count, identity, position L/CL/C/CR/R,
duration in frames @ 25 FPS).

Target platform: ComfyUI on RunPod. Repo is cloned fresh on each RunPod pod
(that's why custom nodes live here, not in a registry).

## Build method — IMPORTANT, do not deviate

1. **One node at a time.** Discuss design → update plan/Excel if needed → write
   code → commit → move on. Never skip ahead.
2. **Commit per node.** Each node's history is independently reviewable.
3. **GitHub is the deployment bridge.** Local dev → push → RunPod clones.
4. **The canonical spec lives in `docs/PLAN.md` + `docs/Node_Plan.xlsx`.** Any
   design change to a node updates BOTH files before the code is written.

## Active work — Node 1 open questions (pending user decision)

Before writing any Node 1 code, the user must answer:

1. **Form shape:** (a) one big form with repeating "+ Add shot" blocks, OR
   (b) wizard-style one-shot-per-page?
2. **metadata.json delivery:** (a) browser download button, OR (b) local Python/Node
   server that POSTs straight into the pipeline folder?
3. **Character identity dropdown:** (a) separate "Character library" page to
   pre-register, OR (b) upload sheet + type name inline on same form?

Claude's default recommendation if the user says "just go": **1a + 2a + 3a**.

## Locked conventions (do not re-litigate)

- **25 FPS** is fixed. No variable frame rate anywhere.
- **Output color** is Black & White line art. No color pass in Part 1.
- **Held frames are NEVER regenerated** by the AI — only duplicated at Node 9C
  to preserve the original rough-animatic timing exactly. This is core to the
  design and is why Node 4 splits key poses from held frames.
- **Character model sheet = 8-angle horizontal strip**, transparent/black bg,
  full color. Node 6 must auto-slice via alpha-island bbox, use **8-bin** angle
  matching (not 4), and run line-art extraction on the selected crop before
  IP-Adapter/Reference-Only conditioning so the reference is BnW-aligned.
- **Canonical angle order** (left→right on the sheet): back, back-¾-L, profile-L,
  front-¾-L, front, front-¾-R, profile-R, back-¾-R. *(Pending final user
  confirmation — flag this when first touching Node 6.)*
- **Position codes:** L / CL / C (exact center) / CR / R.

## Environment gotchas

- **GitHub CLI path:** `C:\Users\Omkar Hajare\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\GitHub.cli_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\bin\gh.exe`.
  New PowerShell windows find `gh` on PATH; older sessions need the full path.
- **Git identity** is set **locally in this repo only** (not globally) —
  `Omkar Hajare <189162401+Omkar8369@users.noreply.github.com>`. Do not change
  the global config.
- **GitHub user:** `Omkar8369` (id `189162401`). Repo is **public** at
  https://github.com/Omkar8369/animatic-refinement.
- **Python is NOT installed** on this Windows machine. Do not invoke `python`
  directly — tasks requiring Python must run on RunPod (where Python is
  available) or be rewritten as PowerShell + Excel COM / Node.js / etc.
- **Shell:** user's primary shell is Git Bash (Unix-style); PowerShell tool is
  also available for Windows-specific operations.

## How to pick up where we left off

1. Read this file (you just did).
2. Read `docs/PLAN.md` for the full 11-node spec.
3. Check `git log --oneline` to see the last committed node.
4. If a node is marked ACTIVE in the status table, resume its open questions
   (listed above). If not, confirm with the user which node to start next.
5. **Never** write code for a node whose design discussion hasn't been resolved
   with the user.
